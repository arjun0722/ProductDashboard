hello Arjun Rawat this side , 

In this project i well maintained the codes in seperate file which name according to their work . All component file maintain in a particular component file . 

key of projects :-
1. Their is add form for the prodcuts like you can add name , price etc .

2. Images should be upload in the form of src , because for the upload image i have to store that image in my project folder so i choose src path, it easy and no limit for image .

3.After add the products form , product will display in cart section in card form . 

4.You can sort the products by price factor and stars too .

5.I use REDUX for the data transfer or prop drilling in nested components .

6.Props can be used , props is easy to drill , but it make code more dirty or uncontrolled look .

7.List's Delete button will delete the product data from local storage and redux too . I menationed in cartSlice.js ,
but in cart's delete the prodcut item delete from redux only by which it cant affect local storage data . 

8.After add to cart you will get and inbox message about the product .
